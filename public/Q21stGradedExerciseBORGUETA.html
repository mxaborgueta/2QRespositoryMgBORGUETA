                <h2>Description of <span style="color: red;">The</span> Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        Forsaken is an asymmetrical <span style="color: red;">"killer vs. <span style="color: lightblue;">survivors</span>"</span> type game where the
                        survivor's objective is to survive until the timer runs out. The killers, however,
                        have the objective of killing every survivor on the map, each kill granting more
                        time for them to play around with. To counter this, survivors can complete generators to decrease the time.
                        As of the moment, there are 5 killers and 10 survivors, all of them having special gameplay of their own.
                    </p>

                        Survivors are the people who are <span style="color: red;"><b>DAMNED</b></span> in this eternal hell.
                        Their only objective is to survive until 4 minutes are up. However, each death adds 30 seconds
                        onto the current timer, causing the failure of protecting your teammates to be detrimental.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text">There are three types of survivors:</p>

                <h2 style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Sentinels</h2>
                <img src="../assets/guest1337.png" width="180" alt="Guest1337">
                    <p>
                        They help the team live by stunning the killer and taking hits for other survivors. Gameplay of this class is
                        usually adrenaline-rushing as there's always a risk of you dying when saving someone.
                    </p>
                <h2 style="color: purple;">Survivalists</h2>
                <img src="../assets/007n7.png" width="180" alt="007n7">
                    <p>
                        Their abilities focus on saving themselves more than their teammates. Gameplay of this class is highly-pressuring due to the fact
                        the killer will <span style="color: red;"><b>ALWAYS</b></span> get you.
                    </p>
                <h2 style="color: lightgreen">Supports</h2>
                <img src="../assets/taph.png" width="180" alt="Taph">
                    <p>
                        They support the team with healing, placing down buildings that slow down the killer, or traps that explode
                        and blind them.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="center-text">Killers: <span style="color: red;">Executioners</span> on the Field</h2>
                <img class="center-img" src="../assets/slasher.png" width="150" alt="Slasher">
                    <p class="center-text">
                        The people who were recrutied by the <span style="color: black;">SPECTRE</span>. Many of these killers have back stories
                        that I won't go into detail with. The objective of the killers are to eliminate <b>EVERY</b> survivor on the map. Each kill adds
                        another 30 seconds to the current timer, giving you more time to chase the prey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text">There are 3 types of killers that follow different play-styles:</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: green;">Rushdown/Damage-Focus</h2>
                <img src="../assets/Hacklord.png" width="180" alt="Hacklord">
                    <p>
                        These killers primarily focus on damage, having abilities that does such. When being chase by a killer of this type,
                        it is harder to shake them off due to the fact that they need to get up close and personal to kill you. Did I mention most
                        of the killers, especially a <span style="color: green;">certain</span> one, have ranged moves?
                    </p>
                <h2 style="color: lightyellow;">Trappers</h2>
                <img src="../assets/john-doe.png" width="180" alt="John Doe">
                    <p>
                        Their name already hinting at what they do, they primarily get their damage from cornering prey by either setting up
                        traps or blocking them from exits. These traps either heavily slow down the prey caught or heavily damage them.
                        A <span style="color: yellow;">certain</span> killer specializes in this field.
