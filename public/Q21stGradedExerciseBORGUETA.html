                Forsaken is an asymmetrical "killer vs. survival" type game where the
                survivor's objective is to survive until the timer runs out. The killers, however,
                have the objective of killing every survivor on the map, each kill granting more
                time for them to play around with. As of the moment, there are 5 killers and
                10 survivors, all of them having special gameplay of their own. test

            <p>
                Survivors are the people who are <b>DAMNED</b> in this eternal hell. Their only
                objective is to survive until 4 minutes are up. However, each death adds 30 seconds
                onto the current timer, causing the failure of protecting your teammates being detrimental.
