                    <p>
                        Forsaken is an asymmetrical <span style="color: red;">"killer vs. survival"</span> type game where the
                        survivor's objective is to survive until the timer runs out. The killers, however,
                        have the objective of killing every survivor on the map, each kill granting more
                        time for them to play around with. Survivors however can complete generators to decrease the time.
                        As of the moment, there are 5 killers and 10 survivors, all of them having special gameplay of their own.
